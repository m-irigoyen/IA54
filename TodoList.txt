FIX
- Relative angles are still bugged
- The "Currently placing : " helper text, on the simulator window, is buggy. After switching problems, it display weird

TODO:
- Wave physics (that's a big one)
- Solve rocket 2 engines
- Implement Rocket 3 engines
- Implement standard force interactions between bodies

PROJECT GOALS : 
- Check if there is an optimal distance between emitters and receptors to solve the rocket problem
